## 2.0.0 - 2017/12/14

### Breaking changes

Most breaking changes should not affect you unless you built custom
infrastructure around License Adapter model classes. Important changes
are noted in bold.

- **The `Licenses#load(List<LicenseEntry>)` method is no longer necessary
  and has been removed.**
- **The `LicenseEntry` has been renamed to `Library` to minimize
  confusion.**
  - The `LicenseAdapter`'s constructor takes in a list of `Library`s
    instead of `LicenseEntry`s.
- The standard AppCompat color resources (`colorPrimary`,
  `colorPrimaryDark`, `colorAccent`) are now required.
- Models no longer implement `Parcelable`, are final, and follow proper
  Java Bean getter/setter naming conventions.
- The `name()`, `version()`, and `link()` getters on the `LicenseEntry`
  are no longer present in the `Library` interface as they weren't being
  used.
- The `Licenses` entry point is now final and cannot be instantiated.
- `Library` implementation are no longer accessible. The `Licenses`
  class should cover all cases. If it doesn't, please file an issue!
- The `BaseLibrary` class now has a simple API which automatically
  performs in-memory and on-disk caching and can be extended if necessary.

### New features

- Completely revamped UI and improved UX
- On-demand license legal text loading instead of all at once when it
  isn't necessarily needed
- On-device and in-memory (config change resilient) caching for optimal
  performance
- Uses vector drawables to minimize resources
- Massively improved API surface

### Bug fixes

- Input streams weren't closed properly
- If license text took too long to load, it wouldn't be displayed


## 1.4.1 - 2017/09/XX

### Changes

- Update to SDK26
- Update to Support Library 26.1.0


## 1.4.0 - 2016/02/05

Thanks [@SUPERCILEX](https://github.com/SUPERCILEX) for adding great new features(#22, #25)!

### Change

- Deprecate `LicenseEntry#link` and add `LicenseEntry#url`(for naming consistency). [PR #27](https://github.com/yshrsmz/LicenseAdapter/pull/27)
- Update dependencies

### Enhancement

- Add `Licenses#FILE_AUTO` option which automatically check & load `LICENSE` file regardless of its extension. [PR #22](https://github.com/yshrsmz/LicenseAdapter/pull/22)
- `Licenses#fromGitHubApacheV2(String)`, `Licenses#fromGitHubMIT(String)` and `Licenses#fromGitHubBSD(String)` now check & load appropriate "LICENSE" file automatically. [PR #22](https://github.com/yshrsmz/LicenseAdapter/pull/22)
  While this feature is convenient, it can increase network access. If you are certain about LICENSE file name and don't mind doing extra work, I recommend you to specify license filename explicitly.
- Add `NoLinkLicenseEntry` to display a license of which content is provided as a String. [PR #25](https://github.com/yshrsmz/LicenseAdapter/pull/24)


## 1.3.0 - 2016/01/09

### Change

- Deprecate `Licenses#fromGitHub(String)` and `Licenses#fromGitHub(String, String)`, since these methods implicitly use Apache v2 as default license.

### Enhancement

- Add `Licenses#fromGitHubApacheV2(String)`, `Licenses#fromGitHubApacheV2(String, String)`, `Licenses#fromGitHubMIT(String)`, `Licenses#fromGitHubMIT(String, String)`, `Licenses#fromGitHubBSD(String)`, `Licenses#fromGitHubBSD(String, String)`.
  For other licenses, use `Licenses#fromGitHub(String, License)` and `Licenses#fromGitHub(String, String, String)`, the same as before.
